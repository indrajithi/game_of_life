# Conway's Game of Life in Python

- We use [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) for terminal display
- Rules of the game can be found here [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Supports terminal resizing

## How to run

`python src/game_of_life.py`

## Improvements

- [] Add pause play and accept mouse input and allow user to make a cell alive or dead
- [] Handle complexity when the matrix size increases
- [] Avoid checking life of a cell multiple times
